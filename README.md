### Overview

While workshop will be mostly based on frontend, we will explore what is GraphQL and how to make your own simple GraphQL server. We will leverage that knowledge to build a highly reusable and scalable React app, using flow as a static type checker to make our app even more robust.

We all worked with standard REST APIs and it get's complicated quite fast on the frontend, I will try to show you how GraphQL can save you time and make your life easier.

GraphQL is a data query language developed by Facebook under MIT license. It is not tied with any specific database or specific programming language or storage. It provides a way to define the complete description of data in the schema and allows a client to ask for what they need and it simply returns the response in JSON.

This will be a hands-on workshop where we will show how a GraphQL server looks like and build a React app leveraging GraphQL superpowers.
